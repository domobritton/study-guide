* Flash Card Question/Answer 

Q: How do we define a graph mathematically?
A: G = (V, E) where 'V' is a set of vertices or nodes together with a set of 'E' edges, arcs, or lines.

Q: What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
A: Directed graph is a graph that is a set of vertices connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them.

Undirected graph has edges with no orientation.

Q: Give an example of a weighted graph
A:

Q: Give a high level overview of what an objects prototype represents
A: Nearly all objects in JS are instances of Object. A typical object inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype.

Q: What are differences between __proto__ and prototype attributes?
A: prototype is not available on the instances themselves (or other objects), but only on the constructor functions. prototype is only available on functions since they are copied from Function and Object, but in anything else it is not. However,__proto__ is available everywhere.

Q: What is an objects default prototype?
A: An object has a prototype property that is empty by default. We can attach properties and methods on this prototype property when we want to implement inheritence.

Q: What happens when we do or don't explicitly set an object's prototype?
A: ???

Q: Name 5 benefits of HTML5
A: 
1) Mutuality for embedding video, audio, charts, animation and more...
2) Cleaner markup by removing divs and replacing with semantic HTML5 elements
3) Elegant forms for reduced need for javascript
4) Offline Application cache for the dev to specify files that the browser should cache, for pages that will reload correctly offline/refresh
5) Geolocation support is directly available to any HTML5-compatible browser

Q: What is localStorage? How might we use it?
A: Allows us to access a Storage object for the Documents origin; stored data is saved across browser sessions. Its useful to store application data in the browser for later usage.

Q: Why are media queries useful?
A: They are useful to implement responsive design; that resizes content dynamically to fit many different devices/browsers

Q: What is mobile-first design?
A: The mobile-first approachis designing for the smallest screen and working your way up. It is one of the best strategies to create responsive or adaptive design

Q: What is a Javascript closure?
A: It is an inner function that has access to the outer enclosing functions variables/scope chain. There are 3 scope chains that it has access to. 1. Its own. 2. The outer functions variables. 3. The global variables.

Q: What are the benefits of a JS closure?
A: It allows you to bind a variable to an execution context and isolate it from being accessed from the outside.

Q: What is data encapsulation?
A: In JS function variables can be hidden from any code outside its definition throught the use of closures.

Q: What happens when you type www.google.com and hit enter?
A: 
1) The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address.
2) If the URL is not in the cache, ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts the URL
3) Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server 
4) Browser sends an HTTP request to the server
5) The server handles the request and sends back a response
7) The server sends out an HTTP response
8) The browser displays HTML content for the response

Q: What is the difference between the memory heap and call stack in JS?
A: Variables in JS are stored in both places. A stack is usually a continuous region of memory allocating local contect for each executing function. A heap is a much larger region storing everything allocated dynamically.

Q: What is one problem with programming languages that are fully single-threaded?
A: It will only allow for one task to be done at a time synchronously. Having multiple threads may not speed up execution of code, but can split work up to allow the computer to process several tasks asynchronously.

Q: Is JS a single-threaded language?
A: Though it is technically true that it is a single-threaded language, unlike other scripting languages, JS was created to interact with browsers and utilizes web workers to execute code asynchronously.

Q: In which order do the React Lifecycle methods (including the optional ones) run?
A: Initialization => Mounting => Updating => Unmounting

Q: In which lifecycle methods should you make asynchronous fetches for data?
A: componentDidUpdate, componentDidMount

Q: What is the difference between composition and inheritance in JS functional programming?
A: They are design choices. Inheritance is building based upon what an object is, Composition is building based upon what an object does.
